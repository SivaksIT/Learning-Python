### **1.5 Basic Python Syntax**

**Indentation:** In Python, indentation (using spaces or tabs) is essential. It indicates a block of code.

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented!")
```

**Comments:** Anything after a `#` in Python is a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.

```python
# This is a comment
print("This is not a comment")
```

**Variables:** In Python, you can assign values to variables without declaring their data type.

```python
name = "John"
age = 30
```
